### 🧠 **RuvScan — Summary**

> **RuvScan** is a sublinear-intelligence MCP server that continuously scans GitHub to uncover *non-obvious leverage* — tools, algorithms, and ideas that can 10× what developers are building. Instead of searching by keywords, it uses **Ruvnet’s own computational brain** — the `sublinear-time-solver` for O(log n) semantic comparison, **FACT** for deterministic reasoning replay, and **SAFLA** for analogical, “outside-the-box” inference.
>
> The result is a fast, self-learning system that *thinks conceptually*, not literally. A developer can describe what they’re trying to achieve — “speed up context recall,” “improve agent orchestration,” “reduce API latency” — and RuvScan instantly finds unexpected matches from across open source, explaining *how* and *why* they apply.
>
> By combining Rust-level computation, Python-based reasoning, and Go-powered scanning, RuvScan turns the entire GitHub ecosystem into a **live, searchable intelligence layer**. It gives builders leverage in three ways:
>
> 1. **Discovery acceleration** — find powerful frameworks you’d never have searched for.
> 2. **Creative transfer** — see how unrelated technologies can be repurposed.
> 3. **Execution speed** — integrate sublinear and reproducible reasoning directly into your workflow.
>
> In short, RuvScan lets developers build smarter and faster by transforming global code into **actionable, deterministic insight**.
