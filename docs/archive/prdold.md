# üß† **Product Requirements Document (PRD) ‚Äì RuvScan MCP**

### **Version:** v0.2 (Generalized MVP)

### **Owner:** Colm Byrne (Flout Labs)

### **Date:** October 2025

### **Tagline:**

> ‚ÄúRuvScan: The MCP that finds leverage you didn‚Äôt know existed ‚Äî anywhere on GitHub.‚Äù

---

## 1. üéØ Product Summary

**RuvScan** is an **MCP-compliant intelligence discovery server** that continuously scans selected GitHub repositories or organizations and transforms their READMEs into structured, queryable *Leverage Cards*.

Unlike keyword search, RuvScan performs **conceptual reasoning** to identify *non-obvious reuse opportunities* between what you‚Äôre building and what already exists elsewhere.

---

## 2. üß© Problem Statement

Developers and product builders waste time reinventing existing tools, libraries, and ideas because:

* GitHub discovery is keyword-based, not conceptual.
* Existing recommendation systems surface *similar* projects, not *complementary* ones.
* The ‚Äúoutside-the-box‚Äù mapping between a repo‚Äôs purpose and your intent is invisible.

**RuvScan** turns this invisible layer visible ‚Äî an *MCP scout agent* that constantly asks:

> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs already out there that could 10√ó what you‚Äôre doing right now?‚Äù

---

## 3. üí° Product Goals

### ‚úÖ **Primary Goals**

1. **Scan any GitHub source**

   * Organization (e.g., `ruvnet`), user, topic, or list of repos.
   * Parse metadata and README.md content.
2. **Summarize each repo into a structured Leverage Card**

   * Core capabilities
   * Tech stack
   * Non-obvious leverage (‚Äúhow else could this be used?‚Äù)
3. **Expose results through a local MCP server**

   * `/scan` ‚Üí triggers or schedules scanning
   * `/query` ‚Üí accepts natural-language intents
   * `/cards` ‚Üí returns stored summaries
4. **Support ‚Äúoutside-the-box‚Äù reasoning**

   * Uses an LLM to infer potential secondary or abstract uses.

### üö´ **Non-Goals**

* Full code-base analysis (beyond README / metadata).
* UI/UX dashboard (MVP is CLI + MCP only).
* Automated pull-request generation or code modification.

## 4. üß† Core User Stories

| # | User Story                                                                              | Acceptance Criteria                                    |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | As a builder, I want to **point RuvScan to any GitHub org or repo list**                | Config supports `target: org`, `user`, or `repo-list`  |
| 2 | As a user, I want to **scan repos and summarize them**                                  | `/scan` parses ‚â•50 repos and stores structured JSON    |
| 3 | As a builder, I want to **ask questions like ‚Äúwhat could optimize my context recall?‚Äù** | `/query` returns ranked Leverage Cards with rationales |
| 4 | As a developer, I want to **run RuvScan locally via MCP**                               | `ruvscan serve` spins up FastAPI MCP server            |
| 5 | As a team, I want **periodic auto-scan + diff detection**                               | Scheduler detects new/updated repos and updates index  |

         +----------+----------+
                    |
         +----------+----------+
         |  Local DB (SQLite)  |
         +---------------------+
```

* **Scanner**: pulls repo names + READMEs via GitHub GraphQL API.
* **Summarizer**: LLM generates Leverage Cards (JSON).
* **Storage**: lightweight DB (SQLite or Supabase).
* **MCP Server**: exposes query + scan endpoints for external tools.
* **Client**: IDE plugin or CLI querying `/query`.

## 12. ‚ö° Example Query Flow

**User (CLI):**

```bash
ruvscan query "find libraries to visualize agent reasoning"
```

**MCP Response:**

```json
{
  "repo": "github.com/ruvnet/infinity-ui",
  "summary": "Sci-fi inspired interface for agentic visualization.",
  "outside_box_reasoning": "Could serve as a debugging lens for agent clusters in AMP.",
  "integration_hint": "Use as front-end visualization template.",
  "relevance_score": 0.88
}
```

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
RuvScan becomes your *contextual, cross-repo intelligence layer*.
It‚Äôs simple, open, and generalizable ‚Äî a **local MCP that helps any builder think laterally across GitHub‚Äôs collective mind.**

Would you like me to now create the **project folder structure + FastAPI/MCP stub code** so you can drop it into Cursor or Replit to begin the MVP?
