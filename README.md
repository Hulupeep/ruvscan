## 💬 Using RuvScan in Claude

Once installed, just talk to Claude naturally:

### Example 1: Scan GitHub Organizations

**You:** "Scan the Anthropics GitHub organization"

**Claude:** *Uses `scan_github` tool*
```
Scan initiated for org: anthropics
Status: initiated
Estimated repositories: 50
Message: Scan initiated - workers processing in background
```

### Example 2: Find Solutions for Your Problem

**You:** "I'm building a real-time AI app. My context retrieval from the vector database is too slow. What can help?"

**Claude:** *Uses `query_leverage` tool and shows you:*

```
Repository: ruvnet/sublinear-time-solver
Relevance Score: 0.94
Complexity: O(log n)

Summary: TRUE O(log n) matrix solver with Johnson-Lindenstrauss projection

Why This Helps: Don't search your entire vector database. Use JL projection
to reduce dimensionality from 1536 → O(log n), then search in compressed space.
600× faster with <3% accuracy loss.

How to Use: Install as MCP tool via: npx sublinear-time-solver mcp

Capabilities: O(log n) solving, WASM acceleration, MCP integration
```

### Example 3: Compare Frameworks

**You:** "Compare facebook/react and vuejs/core for me"

**Claude:** *Uses `compare_repositories` tool*
```
Repository Comparison (O(log n) complexity)

facebook/react vs vuejs/core

Similarity Score: 0.78
Complexity: O(log n)

Analysis: Both are component-based UI frameworks with virtual DOM, but React
has larger ecosystem and more enterprise adoption. Vue has simpler learning
curve and better built-in state management.
```

### Example 4: Understand the Reasoning

**You:** "Show me the reasoning chain for why you recommended that solver"

**Claude:** *Uses `analyze_reasoning` tool*
```
Reasoning Chain for ruvnet/sublinear-time-solver:

- Detected performance optimization intent
- Matched O(log n) complexity with vector search problem
- Found Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimension reduction capability
- Cross-domain transfer from scientific computing to AI/ML
- Verified WASM support for browser integration

(Retrieved from FACT deterministic cache)
```

## 🎯 What Is This?

**RuvScan is GitHub search that actually understands what you're trying to build.**

### The Problem

You're building something new. You know there's probably a library, framework, or algorithm out there that could 10× your project. But:

- 🔍 **Search is broken** - You'd have to know the exact keywords
- 📚 **Too many options** - Millions of repos, most irrelevant
- 🎯 **Wrong domain** - The best solution might be in a totally different field
- ⏰ **Takes forever** - Hours of browsing docs and READMEs

### The Solution

**RuvScan thinks like a creative developer**, not a search engine:

```
You: "I'm building an AI app. Context recall is too slow."

RuvScan: "Here's a sublinear-time solver that could replace your
          vector database queries. It's from scientific computing,
          but the O(log n) algorithm applies perfectly to semantic
          search. Here's how to integrate it..."
```

**It finds:**
- ✨ **Outside-the-box solutions** - Tools from other domains that apply to yours
- ⚡ **Performance wins** - Algorithms you didn't know existed
- 🔧 **Easy integration** - Tells you exactly how to use what it finds
- 🧠 **Creative transfers** - "This solved X, but you can use it for Y"

---

## 🚀 What Can You Build With This?

RuvScan powers **3 types of killer tools**:

### 1. 🏗️ Builder Co-Pilot (IDE Integration)

**Imagine**: Your code editor that suggests relevant libraries as you type.

```javascript
// You're writing:
async function improveContextRetrieval(query) {
  // ...
}

// RuvScan suggests:
💡 Found: sublinear-time-solver
   "Replace linear search with O(log n) similarity"
   Relevance: 0.94 | Integration: 2 minutes
```

**Use Cases**:
- VS Code extension
- Cursor integration
- GitHub Copilot alternative
- JetBrains plugin

### 2. 🤖 AI Agent Intelligence Layer

**Imagine**: Your AI agents that automatically discover and integrate new tools.

```python
# Your AI agent:
agent.goal("Optimize database queries")

# RuvScan finds and explains:
{
  "tool": "cached-sublinear-solver",
  "why": "Replace O(n²) joins with O(log n) approximations",
  "how": "pip install sublinear-solver && ..."
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Autonomous coding agents
- DevOps automation
- System optimization bots
- Research assistants

### 3. 📊 Discovery Engine (Product/Research)

**Imagine**: A tool that finds innovation opportunities across your entire tech stack.

```bash
$ ruvscan scan --org mycompany
$ ruvscan query "What could 10× our ML pipeline?"

Found 8 leverage opportunities:
1. Replace sklearn with sublinear solver (600× faster)
2. Use MidStream for real-time inference (80% cost savings)
3. ...
```

**Use Cases**:
- Tech stack audits
- Performance optimization hunts
- Architecture reviews

## 🎨 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Performance Optimization

**You ask:**
```
"My AI app loads context from a vector database.
 It's too slow for real-time chat."
```

**RuvScan finds:**
```json
{
  "repo": "ruvnet/sublinear-time-solver",
  "outside_box_reasoning": "Don't search the entire vector DB.
    Use Johnson-Lindenstrauss projection to reduce dimensionality
    from 1536 → O(log n), then search in compressed space.
    600× faster with <3% accuracy loss.",
  "integration_hint": "Install as MCP tool:
    npx sublinear-time-solver mcp"
}
```

### Example 2: Architecture Discovery

**You ask:**
```
"Need a way to replay AI reasoning for debugging."
```

**RuvScan finds:**
```json
{
  "repo": "ruvnet/FACT",
  "outside_box_reasoning": "FACT caches every LLM interaction
    with deterministic hashing. Replay any conversation
    exactly as it happened. Built for reproducible AI.",
  "integration_hint": "from fact import FACTCache;
    cache = FACTCache()"
}
```

### Example 3: Domain Transfer

**You ask:**
```
"Building a recommendation system. Need fast similarity."
```

**RuvScan finds:**
```json
{
  "repo": "scientific-computing/spectral-graph",
  "outside_box_reasoning": "This is from bioinformatics,
    but the spectral clustering algorithm works perfectly
    for collaborative filtering. O(n log n) vs O(n²).",
  "integration_hint": "Adapt the adjacency matrix code
    to your user-item matrix"
}
```

## 🔥 Why RuvScan Is Different

### Traditional Search
```
You → "vector database speed" → GitHub
Results: 10,000 vector DB libraries
Problem: You already KNEW about vector databases
```

### RuvScan
```
You → "My vector DB is slow" → RuvScan
Results: Sublinear algorithms, compression techniques,
         caching strategies from OTHER domains
Problem: SOLVED with ideas you'd never have found
```

**The secret**: RuvScan uses:
- 🧠 **Semantic understanding** (not keyword matching)
- 🔀 **Cross-domain reasoning** (finds solutions from other fields)
- ⚡ **Sublinear algorithms** (TRUE O(log n) similarity search)
- 🎯 **Deterministic AI** (same question = same answer, always)

---

## 🎓 For Engineers: How It Works

Now let's get technical...

### Architecture: Tri-Language Hybrid System

RuvScan is built as a **hybrid intelligence system** combining:

```
🐍 Python  → MCP Orchestrator (FastAPI)
            → FACT Cache (deterministic reasoning)
            → SAFLA Agent (analogical inference)

🦀 Rust    → Sublinear Engine (gRPC)
            → Johnson-Lindenstrauss projection
            → TRUE O(log n) semantic comparison

🐹 Go      → Concurrent Scanner (GitHub API)
            → Rate-limited fetching
            → Parallel processing
```

### The Intelligence Stack

#### 1. Sublinear Similarity (Rust)

**Problem**: Comparing your query to 10,000 repos is O(n) — too slow.

**Solution**: Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimension reduction.

```rust
// Reduce 1536-dimensional vectors to O(log n)
let jl = JLProjection::new(1536, 0.5);
let reduced = jl.project(&embedding);

// Now compare in compressed space
let similarity = sublinear_similarity(&query, &corpus);
// Complexity: O(log n) vs O(n)
```

**Mathematical guarantee**: Distances preserved within (1 ± ε).

#### 2. FACT Cache (Python)

**Problem**: LLM reasoning is non-deterministic — can't reproduce results.

**Solution**: Deterministic prompt caching with SHA256 hashing.

```python
# Same input always produces same output
cache_hash = hashlib.sha256(prompt.encode()).hexdigest()
cached_result = fact_cache.get(cache_hash)

if cached_result:
    return cached_result  # 100% reproducible
```

**Benefit**: Every insight is reproducible, auditable, versioned.

#### 3. SAFLA Reasoning (Python)

**Problem**: Literal similarity misses creative reuse opportunities.

**Solution**: Analogical reasoning across domains.

```python
# Detect domain overlap
intent_concepts = ["performance", "search", "real-time"]
repo_capabilities = ["O(log n)", "sublinear", "algorithms"]

# Generate creative transfer
insight = safla.generate_outside_box_reasoning(
    query="speed up vector search",
    repo="scientific-computing/sparse-solver"
)
# → "Use sparse matrix techniques for approximate NN"
```

**Benefit**: Finds solutions from completely different fields.

#### 4. Concurrent Scanning (Go)

**Problem**: GitHub has 100M+ repos — can't scan them all.

**Solution**: Parallel workers with smart rate limiting.

```go
// 10 concurrent workers
for _, repo := range repos {
    go scanner.processRepo(repo)
}

// Auto rate-limit
scanner.checkRateLimit()
// Sleeps if < 100 requests remaining
```

**Benefit**: Scan 100s of repos/minute without hitting limits.
