## 🚀 Publishing Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# On GitHub.com:
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Name: ruvscan
3. Description: 🧠 The AI that finds the code you didn't know you needed - Sublinear-intelligence MCP server for discovering GitHub leverage
4. Public: ✅
5. Don't initialize (we have files)
6. Create repository
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd /home/xanacan/Dropbox/code/ruvscan

# Initialize (if needed)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "🎉 Initial release: RuvScan v0.5.0

Complete sublinear-intelligence MCP server

Features:
- TRUE O(log n) semantic similarity
- FACT deterministic caching
- SAFLA analogical reasoning
- Tri-language (Python/Rust/Go)
- MCP protocol
- Production-ready

What you can build:
- AI code assistants
- Autonomous agents
- Discovery platforms
- Research tools"

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvscan.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Create v0.5.0 Release

```bash
# Tag
git tag -a v0.5.0 -m "RuvScan v0.5.0 - Initial MVP

Complete sublinear-intelligence MCP server.
See CHANGELOG.md for details."

# Push tag
git push origin v0.5.0

# Then on GitHub:
# - Go to Releases
# - Draft new release
# - Choose tag v0.5.0
# - Title: 🧠 RuvScan v0.5.0
# - Publish
```

### Step 4: Configure Repository

**Topics to add:**
```
mcp
model-context-protocol

## 📣 Promotion Strategy

### 1. Twitter/X Launch

```
🧠 Just launched RuvScan - The AI that finds code you didn't know you needed!

Instead of keyword search:
"vector database" → 10,000 DBs you already know

RuvScan finds:
"slow vector search" → O(log n) algorithms from scientific computing

Built with:
✅ TRUE O(log n) similarity
✅ Deterministic AI (FACT)
✅ Cross-domain reasoning

Try it: github.com/ruvnet/ruvscan

#AI #MCP #OpenSource #DeveloperTools
```

### 2. Show HN

**Title:**
"Show HN: RuvScan – AI that finds GitHub repos you'd never search for"

**Description:**
```
Hey HN!

I built RuvScan - an MCP server that discovers code solutions from
domains you'd never think to search.

The problem: GitHub has millions of repos, but search only works if
you know what keywords to use. If the best solution is in a different
domain (like using scientific computing for web apps), you'll never
find it.

RuvScan uses:
- O(log n) semantic similarity (Johnson-Lindenstrauss)
- Deterministic caching (FACT framework)
- Analogical reasoning (cross-domain transfer)

Example: Ask "speed up my vector DB" → Get sublinear algorithms
from bioinformatics.

It's not just search - it's discovery. Built with Python, Rust, and Go.

Live demo: [link]
Repo: github.com/ruvnet/ruvscan

What do you think? Would love feedback!
```

### 3. Dev.to Article

**Title:**
"I Built an AI That Discovers Code From Other Domains (It's Open Source)"

**Outline:**
1. The problem (GitHub search is broken)
2. The insight (best solutions are cross-domain)
3. The tech (O(log n) + deterministic AI)
4. Real examples (3 case studies)
5. Try it yourself
6. What you can build with it

### 4. Reddit Posts

**r/programming:**
"RuvScan - Find GitHub repos using semantic similarity, not keywords"

**r/MachineLearning:**
"Built an AI that finds ML libraries from other domains using O(log n) similarity"

**r/rust:**
"Open-source project using Rust for sublinear semantic search (RuvScan)"

### 5. Product Hunt

**Tagline:**
"The AI that finds code you didn't know you needed"

**Description:**
"RuvScan scans GitHub semantically, finding solutions from domains you'd never search. Built for developers who want 10× better tools."

```
Subject: RuvScan - Find code from domains you'd never search

Hi [Name],

I just launched RuvScan, an open-source MCP server that helps
developers discover code solutions from unexpected domains.

Instead of keyword search (which only finds what you already know
about), RuvScan uses semantic similarity + cross-domain reasoning.

Example:
You: "My vector database is slow"
RuvScan: "Try this sublinear solver from scientific computing"

It's like having a senior engineer who knows EVERY domain.

Built with Python, Rust, and Go. Production-ready. MIT licensed.

Check it out: github.com/ruvnet/ruvscan

Would love to hear your thoughts!

Best,
[Your name]
```
